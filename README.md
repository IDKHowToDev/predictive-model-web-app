# Predictive Model Web App

## Project Overview
This project is a simple web application built with Flask that provides predictive modeling capabilities. It allows users to submit a set of numerical values and receive a prediction based on those values. The current implementation uses a mock prediction function that returns the average of the input values with some random variation. This mock setup can be replaced later with a more sophisticated predictive model.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-model-web-app.git
   cd predictive-model-web-app
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   Make sure you have `pip` installed and then run:
   ```bash
   pip install flask numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the Flask web server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. 

3. **Make predictions**:
   You can make predictions by sending POST requests to the `/predict` endpoint with the required JSON payload. Here's an example of how to structure your request:
   ```json
   {
     "values": [1.2, 2.3, 3.1],
     "model_type": "mock"
   }
   ```

## Features
- User-friendly web interface for inputting numerical values.
- Simple mock prediction logic for demonstration purposes.
- JSON responses indicating success or failure of the prediction request.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the following dependencies:
- `Flask`: A micro web framework for Python.
- `NumPy`: A library for numerical computing in Python, used here for average calculations.

Make sure these are installed via pip as indicated in the Installation section.
